# The atmos configuration system merges together all the yml files into one
# giant hash, starting with this atmos.yml, then adding in all the files
# matching the patterns in atmos.config_sources
#
# Hashes and arrays are merged in an additive fashion, and scalars are replaced
# based on the merge order (last wins).  e.g.
#   "foo: {bar: 1}, hum: [1]" + "foo: {baz: 2}, hum: [2]" => "foo: {bar: 1, baz: 2}, , hum: [1, 2]"
# You can force an override (vs merge) of a hash or array by prefixing the key
# with a caret (^)
#   "foo: {bar: 1}" + "^foo: {baz: 2}" => "foo: {baz: 2}"
#
# Providers and environment overrides get merged in on top of the hash based on
# the selected provider (aws) and environment (ops/dev/prod/etc).
# The providers and environments key/hash are excluded from the final merged
# configuration hash
#
# The merged configuration hash is provided to terraform at execution time via a
# generated tfvars.json  To access those variables you still need to declare the
# variables you use with a terraform variable declaration in a tf file
